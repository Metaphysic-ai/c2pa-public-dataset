# Metaphysic C2PA Public Dataset

Welcome to the official repository for the Metaphysic C2PA Dataset. This dataset is part of a collaborative effort to support the C2PA initiative, which aims to foster the development of technologies for establishing content provenance and authenticity. The dataset includes experimental data along with a comprehensive C2PA manifest designed to enable research and development in digital content provenance.

## About the Dataset

The Metaphysic C2PA Dataset is a proprietary collection of data that has been specially prepared to facilitate research into content provenance and authenticity technologies. The dataset is experimental and has been curated with ethical considerations at the forefront, ensuring that it aligns with the principles of responsible AI research.

## Dataset Contents

- **C2PA Manifests**: Structured data files containing metadata and provenance information aligned with C2PA standards.
- **Ethical Guidelines**: [Documentation](https://github.com/Metaphysic-ai/c2pa-public-dataset/tree/main) outlining the ethical framework and considerations for using this dataset.
- **Sample Data**: A set of sample entries demonstrating the types of content and metadata included in the dataset.
